# Data and Safety Monitoring Plan

::: {.instr_box .rmdnote}

**This section is required when research involves more than Minimal
Risk to subjects as defined in "HRP-001 SOP- Definitions."**

*Minimal Risk* is defined as the probability and magnitude of harm or discomfort anticipated in the research that are not greater in and of themselves than those ordinarily encountered in daily life or during the performance of routine physical or psychological examinations or tests. 
For research involving prisoners, *Minimal Risk* is the probability and magnitude of physical or psychological harm that is normally encountered in the daily lives, or in the routine medical, dental, or psychological examination of healthy persons.

**Please complete each section below if the research involves more
than minimal risk to subjects or indicate not applicable.**
