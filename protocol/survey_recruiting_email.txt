Dear Penn Stater:

We are a group of faculty who are interested in knowing more about what students, postdocs, staff, faculty, and adminstrators know about open science practices and whether they incorporate open science practices into their research.

Our research goal is to determine whether there is a need for an initiative at Penn State that provides training and support for open science practices and serves as a focal point for open science here.

To that end, we have devised a short survey that should take you no more than 10 min to complete. The survey is created using a Google Form. Participation is voluntary. You may start the survey and choose not to complete it, or you may choose not to complete specific questions. Unless you decide to provide us with your name and email for follow up, no identifiable information will be collected. There is no compensation for participating and no penalty to you for withdrawing once you have started completing the survey.

Once we have analyzed the results, we plan to share them with the Penn State community.

If you have any questions about this research, please contact Rick Gilmore (rog1@psu.edu; 814-865-3664).

Thank you for your consideration.

Yours truly,

Rick Gilmore, Department of Psychology
