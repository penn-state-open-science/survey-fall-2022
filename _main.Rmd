# About {-}

This is a research protocol for *Knowledge about and attitudes toward open science practices among Penn State researchers*, (STUDY00021455: Open science at Penn State) written in **Markdown**.

It also represents an exercise in how to use git-based version control, Rmarkdown, and the `bookdown` package to create an open research protocol that also addresses questions required for the Penn State IRB's protocol review process. 
Our goal is to reduce duplication of effort.

These materials may be copied and reused by anyone.

# Objectives

## Study Objectives

> Describe the purpose, specific aims, or objectives. 

\[State the hypotheses to be tested\].

## Primary Study Endpoints

> State the primary endpoints to be measured in the study.
>
> Research typically has a primary objective or endpoint. Additional
> objectives and endpoints are secondary. The endpoints (or outcomes),
> determined for each study subject, are the quantitative measurements
> required by the objectives. Measuring the selected endpoints is the
> goal of a trial (examples: response rate and survival).
