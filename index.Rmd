# About {-}

This is a research protocol for *Knowledge about and attitudes toward open science practices among Penn State researchers*, (STUDY00021455: Open science at Penn State) written in **Markdown**.

It also represents an exercise in how to use git-based version control, Rmarkdown, and the `bookdown` package to create an open research protocol that also addresses questions required for the Penn State IRB's protocol review process. 
Our goal is to reduce duplication of effort.

These materials may be copied and reused by anyone.

```{r include=FALSE}
# automatically create a bib database for R packages
knitr::write_bib(c(
  .packages(), 'bookdown', 'knitr', 'rmarkdown'
), 'bib/packages.bib')
