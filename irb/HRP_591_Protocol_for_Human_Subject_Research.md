4.  # Recruitment Methods

    -   Upload recruitment materials for your study in CATS IRB
        > (<http://irb.psu.edu>). **DO NOT** include the actual
        > recruitment wording in this protocol.

    -   StudyFinder: If StudyFinder (<http://studyfinder.psu.edu>) is to
        > be used for recruitment purposes, separate recruitment
        > documents do not need to be uploaded in CATS IRB. The
        > necessary information will be captured from the StudyFinder
        > page in your CATS IRB study.

    -   Any eligibility screening questions (verbal/phone scripts,
        > email, etc.) used when contacting potential participants must
        > be uploaded to your study in CATS IRB (<http://irb.psu.edu>).

> \[Do not type here\]

## Identification of subjects

> Describe the source of subjects and the methods that will be used to
> identify potential subjects (e.g., organizational listservs,
> established recruitment databases, subject pools, medical or school
> records, interactions during a clinic visit, etc.). If not recruiting
> subjects directly (e.g., database query for eligible records or
> samples) state what will be queried, how and by whom.
>
> StudyFinder:

-   If you intend to use StudyFinder (<http://studyfinder.psu.edu>) for
    recruitment purposes, include this method in this section.

-   Information provided in this protocol, including the description of
    study procedures, compensation, and recruitment, needs to be
    consistent with information provided on the StudyFinder page in your
    CATS IRB study.

> For Penn State Health submissions using Enterprise Information
> Management (EIM) for recruitment, and for non-Hershey locations as
> applicable, attach your EIM Design Specification form in CATS IRB
> (<http://irb.psu.edu>). See "HRP-103- Investigator Manual, Study
> Recruitment" for additional information.
>
> **DO NOT** include the actual recruitment material or wording in this
> protocol.
>
> \[Type protocol text here\]

## 

## Recruitment process

> Describe how potential subjects first learn about this research
> opportunity or indicate 'not applicable' if subjects will not be
> prospectively recruited to participate in the research. Subject
> recruitment can involve various methods (e.g., approaching potential
> subjects in person, contacting potential subjects via email, letters,
> telephone, ResearchMatch, or advertising to a general public via
> flyers, websites, StudyFinder, newspaper, television, and radio etc.).
> **DO NOT** include the actual recruitment material or wording in this
> protocol.

4.  **Describe the eligibility screening process. Screening begins when
    the investigator obtains information about or from a prospective
    participant in order to determine their eligibility.**

> Eligibility screening is occurring *before* consent\*
>
> Eligibility screening is occurring *after* consent
>
> Consent is not being obtained in this research
>
> Not applicable - Eligibility screening is not being done in this
> research
>
> \[Type protocol text here\]
>
> \*Unless informed consent is waived by the IRB, screening before
> consent is only permitted when screening activities are limited to the
> collection of information through oral or written communication OR
> when identifiable private information or identifiable biospecimens is
> obtained by accessing records or stored identifiable biospecimens.
> Screening before consent is not permitted if data will be used for
> activities other than eligibility screening/recruitment (e.g., data
> analysis). In some studies, these procedures may not take place unless
> HIPAA Authorization is obtained OR a waiver of HIPAA Authorization
> when applicable for the screening procedures is approved by the IRB.
