The purpose of this study is to investigate knowledge about Open Science and its practices among graduate students, postdocs, teaching faculty, research staff, research faculty, and administrators. Open Science is a growing movement to make research more transparent, to share data and code, and to publish in venues that are accessible to all. We aim to understand what our colleagues at Penn State know about Open Science as practiced in their fields. We are also interested in learning what barriers respondents find in their adoption of these practices. 1.2 Primary Study Endpoints State the primary endpoints to be measured in the study. Research typically has a primary objective or endpoint. Additional objectives and endpoints are secondary. The endpoints (or outcomes), determined for each study subject, are the quantitative measurements required by the objectives. Measuring the selected endpoints is the goal of a trial (examples: response rate and survival). Exploration of familiarity with Open Science among researchers and teachers at PSU. 1.3 Secondary Study Endpoints State the secondary endpoints to be measured in the study. Not applicable. "],["background.html", "2 Background 2.1 Scientific Background and Gaps 2.2 Previous Data 2.3 Study Rationale", " 2 Background 2.1 Scientific Background and Gaps Describe the scientific background and gaps in current knowledge. For clinical research studies being conducted at Penn State Health/Penn State College of Medicine, and for other non-PSH locations as applicable, describe the treatment/procedure that is considered standard of care (i.e., indicate how patients would be treated in non-investigational setting); and if applicable, indicate if the study procedure is available to patient without taking part in the study. There is a growing movement in the scientific community towards more openness and transparency: data and code sharing; open access publishing; pre-registration, etc. In part this is in reaction to a perceived crisis of reproducibility and replicability; in part it is due to many high-profile examples of “questionable research practices.” 2.2 Previous Data Describe any relevant preliminary data. The Penn State Libraries conducted a survey of researchers in the physical sciences on somewhat related topics in the last year. That survey was determined to be exempt. Outside of that survey, little is currently known about researchers’ knowledge about common Open Science practices and principles. One of the investigators (Lazar) is part of a team that conducted a similar survey at the University of Georgia focused on graduate students. They found that knowledge about Open Science varies by student field of study. They also found clusters of practices that had similar levels of familiarity among the students. Lazar has recently collected data from but not analyzed some similar survey questions from graduate students in the Huck Institute of the Life Sciences graduate program. This survey was also determined by the PSU IRB to be exempt. 2.3 Study Rationale Provide the scientific rationale for the research. The investigators believe that there is significant need for more organized and focal educational activities and project-specific support related to Open Science. This survey will characterize the current state of knowledge and need for these sorts of activities at Penn State.

Our research goal is to determine whether there is a need for an initiative at Penn State that provides training and support for open science practices and serves as a focal point for open science here. To that end, we have devised a short survey that should take you no more than 10 min to complete. The survey is created using a Google Form. Participation is voluntary. You may start the survey and choose not to complete it, or you may choose not to complete specific questions. Unless you decide to provide us with your name and email for follow up, no identifiable information will be collected. There is no compensation for participating and no penalty to you for withdrawing once you have started completing the survey. Survey link: https://forms.gle/BpK1Zsyw1k3tVnSE7 Once we have analyzed the results, we plan to share them with the Penn State community. If you have any questions about this research, please contact Rick Gilmore (rog1@psu.edu; 814-865-3664). Thank you for your consideration.

Whether or not you take part is up to you. You can choose not to take part. You can agree to take part and later change your mind. Your decision will not be held against you, and there will be no penalty. The study involves a taking a brief survey. The survey focuses on data management and sharing practices and principles of open science. You may choose to answer some questions and not others or start the survey and choose not to complete it. Unless you provide us your name and email, your responses are anonymous. If you provide us your name or contact information we may contact you at a later time. The target audience for the survey is Penn State students, faculty, and staff who are over the age of 18. If you are not 18 and not a Penn State student, faculty member, or staff member, please do not take this survey.
