> Dear Penn Stater:

We are a group of faculty who are interested in knowing more about what students, postdocs, staff, faculty, and adminstrators know about open science practices and whether they incorporate open science practices into their research.

Our goal is to determine whether there is a need for a center that provides training and support for open science practices.

To that end, we have devised a short survey that should take you no more than 10 min to complete. The survey is created using a Google Form, and unless you decide to provide us with your name and email, no identifiable information will be collected. There is no compensation for participating and no penalty to you for withdrawing once you have started completing the survey.

Once we have analyzed the results, we plan to share them with the Penn State community

Thank you for your consideration.

Yours truly,

Rick Gilmore, Department of Psychology
