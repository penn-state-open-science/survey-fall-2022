# IRB

- This folder contains documents related to the IRB application for our Fall 2022 survey.
- As much as possible, we are trying to create an open and reproducible workflow. That means converting the `.docx` files to markdown via pandoc and using git for version control.

## Contents

```{r echo=FALSE}
fs::dir_tree(file.path(here::here(), "irb"))
```

## Action log

- 2022-11-11: ROG submitted version [20221111](submissions/20221111) (`submissions/202211`). Note this submission did not use the rendered `.docx` files.
