Template Version 11/2/2021

## Instructions

**DO NOT ENABLE TRACK CHANGES WHEN MODIFYING THIS DOCUMENT.** Effective
09/01/2021, the PSU HRPP no longer requires completion of this form for
all study team members. Examples of when this form may be required
include but are not limited to:

-   Those study team members who will perform research procedures
    requiring special expertise or credentials above and beyond what is
    typically expected in the course of research conduct and/or clinical
    care;

-   Individuals conducting biomedical procedures in a non-clinical
    setting;

-   Student and faculty advisor for those projects that designate the
    student as Principal Investigator;

-   Individuals participating in the research via execution of an
    Individual Investigator Agreement.

Note, all study team members will still need to be listed in Question #1
on the Study Team Member page of CATS. The Principal Investigator (PI)
should be listed on the Basic Information page of CATS.

Please note: If you will be listing more than four (4) Study Team
Members, duplicate the questions below and extend the template to
provide the information for each additional member. Likewise, if you
will be listing fewer than four (4) Study Team Members, remove the
additional un-needed questions below.

## Instructions for Individuals Using Visual Assistive Technology (e.g., JAWS)

-   There are form fields and instructional text that are outside of the
    form fields, so the best way to navigate through this document is to
    use the down arrow key.

-   To navigate through the checkbox options, after hearing "select all
    that apply," down arrow once for the list of options. When reaching
    an individual checkbox, use the Home button to move to the front of
    the line and right arrow once to hear the properties of the form
    field. Use the spacebar to check or uncheck the box. You may need to
    down arrow and then up arrow again for confirmation on whether the
    checkbox is checked.

-   This document includes entry fields for the PI and up to four study
    team members. If you are using visual assistive technology (i.e., a
    screen reader) and more than four team members need to be added,
    email <ORP@psu.edu> to request a new version of this document. Do
    not complete this document until the new version is provided. If you
    are not using a screen reader, you may simply copy and paste any
    additional fields needed.
